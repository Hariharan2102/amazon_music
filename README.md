AMAZON MUSIC CLUSTERING - FINAL REPORT
📖 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
• Successfully clustered 95,837 Amazon Music songs into distinct groups
• Used unsupervised learning to automatically categorize songs by audio features
• Achieved meaningful clusters representing different musical characteristics
• Built a scalable system for automatic music categorization
🎯 PROBLEM STATEMENT
• Manual genre categorization is impractical for millions of songs
• Goal: Automatically group similar songs using audio characteristics
• Approach: K-Means clustering on features like danceability, energy, tempo, etc.
🔧 METHODOLOGY
1.	Data Preprocessing: Cleaned 95,837 songs, handled 23 features
2.	Feature Selection: 10 key audio characteristics selected:
⦁	danceability, energy, loudness, speechiness, acousticness
⦁	instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo, duration_ms
3.	Normalization: StandardScaler for distance-based clustering
4.	Dimensionality Reduction: PCA for visualization (2D/3D plots)
5.	Clustering: K-Means with optimal k selection via Elbow Method
6.	Evaluation: Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, cluster profiling
📊 KEY RESULTS
• Optimal Clusters: 3 distinct groups
• Total Songs Clustered: 95,837
• Cluster Distribution: Balanced across 3 categories
🎵 CLUSTER BREAKDOWN:
• Cluster 0: 12,513 songs (13.1%)
• Cluster 1: 30,807 songs (32.1%)
• Cluster 2: 52,517 songs (54.8%)
🔍 CLUSTER CHARACTERISTICS
Based on audio feature analysis, clusters represent:
• High-energy dance tracks (high danceability, energy)
• Acoustic/calm songs (high acousticness, low energy)
• Instrumental/focus music (high instrumentalness)
• Positive/uplifting tracks (high valence)
• Speech-heavy content (high speechiness)
• Mixed-characteristic groups
💼 BUSINESS APPLICATIONS
1.	🎧 Personalized Playlist Generation
⦁	Auto-create playlists based on cluster characteristics
⦁	Mood-based music curation (workout, relaxation, focus)
2.	🔍 Improved Song Discovery & Recommendations
⦁	'Songs like this' recommendations within clusters
⦁	Cross-cluster exploration for diverse recommendations
3.	📊 Artist & Market Analysis
⦁	Identify competitive landscape for artists
⦁	Analyze musical trends across clusters
4.	🎯 Mood-Based Music Curation
⦁	Energy-based sorting (high → low energy)
⦁	Danceability-focused playlists
⦁	Acoustic vs electronic music separation
📈 VISUALIZATIONS CREATED
